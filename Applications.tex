AI helps creating smarter sensor systems.

AI systems have been improving, and new advances in machine intelligence are creating seamless interactions between people and digital sensor systems.

 In sensor systems, applications can be found for a variety of tasks, including selection of sensor inputs, interpreting signals, condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, machine and process control, machine design, process planning, production scheduling, and system configuring. Some examples of specific tasks undertaken by expert systems are:
* Assembly 
* Automatic programming 
* Controlling intelligent complex vehicles  
* Planning inspection 
* Predicting risk of disease 
* Selecting tools and machining strategies 
* Sequence planning 
* Controlling plant growth. 

AI can increase effective communication, reduce mistakes, minimize errors, and extend sensor life.



The tools and methods described have minimal computation complexity and can be implemented on small assembly lines, single robots, or systems with low-capability microcontrollers. These novel approaches proposed use ambient intelligence and the mixing of different AI tools in an effort to use the best of each technology. The concepts are generically applicable across many processes.
