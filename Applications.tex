\section{Applications}
\label{App}

\subsection{Overview}

Traditional applications can not achieve complicated and efficient goals due 
to the limited processing power and memory space of sensors.

In {\sdn}, applications for wireless sensor networks are inspired by 
greater potential with the UAV based SDN controller. The central controller
helps sensors execute complex calculations such as AI model training, as well 
as store global information. Besides, UAVs have flexible features and can deploy 
tasks to sensors by one-hop communication directly. Thus it enables the sensor network
to achieve much more intelligent applications.

In {\sdn}, applications can be found for a variety of purposes, including routing, network diagnosis,
AI energy prediction, AI node selection and multi-task. We design all these applications and provide 
easy-to-use interfaces to users as in Table \ref{API}.



\subsection{Routing}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Different from the internet protocol (IP) networks which adopt
routing with shortest path,
traditional WSNs use the RPL (Routing Protocol for LLN) protocol,
focusing on routing with less energy consumption.

Low-Power and Lossy network

The remarkable of SND is its 

is feasible using access control lists (ACLs) and routing protocols. Users can provide 

determine the path of network.

As we discuss before, sensors are limited to their processing capability and storage space.
Thus we simplified flow table and 

Traditional wireless sensor network RPL \cite{Winter2012}.

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing 
protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

In our , we implement OSPF in the

\subsection{Network Diagnosis}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Sensor nodes are provisioned with low-capacity batteries and will run out of energy in the end. 
Besides, uncertain environmental factors will lead to the failure of communications.
Upon these two factors, there occurs network faults such as failure nodes and lossy links from time to time.

Network fault diagnosis is then designed to help network administrators monitor the network 
operational status and maintain a sensor network system. The key idea of the existing works
on fault diagnosis is to collect running information from nodes and deduce root causes of network
exceptions. The running information is collected by a mechanism of probing.

We implement the network diagnosis process as an application in our {\sdn} system.
Since in {\sdn} we have our mobile UAV as a controller, a more flexible way is to infer the suspicious 
nodes of the network fault in traditional way first and then set the UAV to check out the fault sources. 
 
\subsubsection{Design}

We first introduce a state-of-the-art algorithm named DID 
\cite{gong2015directional}, which is a directional diagnosis approach.
We utilize the node tracing module and the tracing collection module of DID
to infer the suspicious nodes in our network diagnosis application, 
and then set our UAV controller to confirm the network elements being faulty.

The node tracing module is conducted in each sensor node. 
Every time a packet arrives at a node, it counts
the source of the packet . The tracing collection module
is set in the UAV controller. When network exception is detected, 
it gathers the tracing information in the tracing module of the relevant nodes
and infers a suspicious node set. Next we set the UAV to fly through the 
node set and check each node first to diagnose the failed nodes. 
Then UAV collects the neighbor lists of all the nodes in the suspicious node set.
With the collected neighbor lists, the UAV controller reconstructs the topical topology and 
compares it with the default topology to find the failed links.

Compared to DID, the diagnosis application in {\sdn} releases the complicated inference
computations and can achieve accurate diagnosis since the UAV can fly to the sensors 
to confirm the network faults. {\sdn} can realize the four types of fault sources the same as DID:  
\begin{itemize}
\item	Node failure. This network failure is caused by the node itself.
\item	Link failure. This network failure is caused by the communication links 
between nodes, mainly relating to traffic flow in networks.
\item	Temporary failure. This  network failure is caused by complex interior or exterior 
interferences and quick self-recovery
\item	Multiple failures. This  network failure is caused by multiple failures above.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AI Energy Prediction}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
Traditional wireless sensor networks (WSN)  generally carry out data 
collection by multi-hop transmission,
and due to limited computation capability and storage capacity, sensors are incapable
to perform deep learning methods for data mining. 
Hence, intelligent self energy consumption optimization for a sensor is hard to achieve.

The sensor next to the data center always has the most frequent routing tasks, which leads to
the heaviest workload and the shortest battery life. Worse more, after the
first sensor runs out of energy, a new sensor will be selected to take the place 
of it with more workload. As a result, its lifetime becomes shorter and the whole 
sensor network will soon run out of energy. We call this energy exhausted problem.

An ideal solution to the energy exhausted problem is to find a self-adjusted routing schedule which 
makes adjustments according to the energy status of each sensor. 
Actually, this is a kind of dynamic programming problem and
the optimization target is to achieve the longest lifetime of the whole network under
complex constrains. We modify linear and simple MLP\cite{Harvey1988An} deep learning model to simulate and simplify
this constrains. Challenges occurs in traditional WSN because of lack
of global energy information. 

In {\sdn}, the UAV controller .   
all these factors makes it possible to execute
this optimization. Besides, the 
The AI prediction application can contribute to the network diagnosis application
This kind of cooperation and mutual assistance makes {\sdn} an effective ecosystem.

\subsubsection{Design}
In our {\sdn} system, we implement a prediction application for 
energy storage of sensors. The architecture of the AI energy prediction
can be seen in Fig. \ref{prediction}. The special system architecture enables
us to analyze the sensor data in real time. After the information 
collected by the sensor is transmitted to database, it is used as
the input of the incremental learning model, which outputs the
life expectancy of each sensor. These predicted information contributes
to other application. 

A sample input of energy information contains at least four components: sensors'
duty cycle, packet-sending time, data receiving time and other energy
consumption. Data collection module records these information with time stamp,
as well as routing information. We use the database to maintain our experimental data,
and use the sql query to manage training data. In this way, we can easily
get each sensor's routing task and energy consumption at any time as input. A forgetting factor
is used to avoid overfitting. Then the model will output the prediction of a energy consumption list in time
sequences. The sensor which is most likely to run out of energy will rank in the first place of the list. 
Combined with our diagnosis application, we can make use of our prediction result to prolong the network
lifetime.

\subsection{AI Node Selection}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

It is inevitable that there will be a part of redundant sensors when deploying a 
practical wireless sensor network. These redundant nodes have overlaps of
observation regions, and what makes the matter worse is that redundant nodes
may cause great communication interference. Therefore it is significant to select 
proper sensors to avoid data redundancy and save the sensor network energy consumption.

In {\sdn}, we provide the node selection application to users. The SDN controller executes the 
selecting algorithm and send the control instructions to activate the selected nodes.

\subsubsection{Design} Our {\sdn} system provide two main node selecting methods: 
greedy selection algorithm and SRSSS algorithm. This application will be extended to more elegant 
algorithms in our future work. 

\textbf{Greedy selection algorithm.} We first provide a simple method to select 
the redundant nodes by a greedy selection algorithm, as described in Alg. \ref{Greedy}. 
The key idea is to select nodes as less as possible to coverage the whole area
 based on the location and sensing range. 
 
We implement the greedy selection algorithm in {\sdn}. The evaluations in section \ref{Eva} 
wshow it greatly saves the sensors' energy and thus prolongs the network lifetime.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Greedy Selection Algorithm}
\label{Greedy}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Input: Sensor set $N$, Selected set $M$, Target area $\Omega$, Covering area $\Phi$;
\STATE Initialize : $M = \emptyset$, $\Phi = \emptyset$
\WHILE {$M \neq N$}
    \IF{$\Phi = \Omega $}
        \STATE break; $\backslash$$\backslash$ Selected set has been found
    \ENDIF
    \IF{$\forall n_i \in (N-M) : range(n_i) \subset \Phi$}
    	 \STATE break;$\backslash$$\backslash$ Cannot cover the target area;
    \ENDIF
    \STATE Find $n_i : argmax(\Phi \cap range(n))$, $n_i \in (N-M)$;
    \STATE $\Phi = \Phi \cup {n_i}$
\ENDWHILE
\STATE Output: $M$;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Spatially regularized streaming sensor selection (SRSSS).} 
To realize more intelligent and effective sensor selection, we introduce 
a state-of-the-art AI algorithm named spatially regularized streaming 
sensor selection (SRSSS) \cite{li2016spatially}.

Different from the greedy selection algorithm, SRSSS is a multi-variate 
interpolation framework and focuses on selecting a subset
of sensors in a streaming scenario to minimize collected information redundancy.  

Traditional wireless sensor network is not suitable to implement an AI selection approach
due to the limited computational capability of sensors. Some work use the database to collect data
and make decisions by multi-hop communications. However, in this way the network will use up a great deal of energy.
In our {\sdn}, the UAV fly through the nodes to pick up the collected data and executes the computations.
Then it sends the control instructions to the nodes by one-hop communication and greatly saves the network energy.

The aim of SRSSS is to optimize its objective function which is an equation given
certain constraints of collected information, location and energy consumption.
The objective function is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\label{OF}
\begin{aligned}
& (W_{k+1},z_{k+1})  \\
& = arg \min_{W,z} \sum_{i=1}^k \mu^{k-i}\lVert X_k^iD_zW(I-D_z)-X_k^i(I-D_z)\rVert^2_2 \\
& + \alpha\sum_{i,j=1}^n\lVert y_i-y_j\rVert_2\lvert W_{i,j} \rvert - \beta\sum_{i,j=1}^n\lVert y_i-y_j\rVert_2 z_iz_j \\
& + \lambda\lVert W \rVert^2_F \\
&s.t. z = [z_1,...,z_n] \in {\{0,1\}}^n, c^Tz \leq P
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The first term in (\ref{OF}) is to minimize the prediction error of the collected data
and the following two terms incorporate spatial information. The last term constrains
the complexity of the learned matrix $W$. The energy constraint is controlled by 
the inequality in (\ref{OF}). Because of the limitation of length,  we leave out all the details. 
The meaning of the parameters and the mechanism of 
SRSSS can be seen in \cite{li2016spatially}. 

With the AI sensor selection process, {\sdn} becomes a smarter and adaptive sensor systems. 






\subsection{Multi-task}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Wireless sensor networks (WSN)  generally comprise of a group of 
spatially dispersed sensors. In a wireless sensor network, 
sensor nodes are equipped with various 
types of sensors monitoring and recording 
environmental conditions like temperature, sound, sunlight,
humidity, etc.

A given sensing task involves multiple sensors to 
achieve a certain quality-of-sensing.
Generally, an efficient task scheduling for the nodes is that nodes 
are able to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. 
For example, sensors deployed in a grove are assigned tasks to collect
sunlight, temperature and humidity data and these tasks require different 
number of  nodes with respective sensing range, rate and duration.
However, traditional sensor networks are not suitable to conduct this 
multi-task due to the limitations of computation complexity for task 
arrangement of each node.

In our {\sdn} system, we implement the multi-task application 
with the help of the central controller. The SDN controller
maintains programmable task scheduling and management
modules while sensor nodes are loaded with interfaces to
receive task control instructions.     

\subsubsection{Design}

A deployed wireless sensor networks are usually assigned  with
different data collection requirement. In {\sdn}, we design and 
implement multi-task application and provide easy-to-use
interfaces to users.

When a user assign a task to {\sdn}, the UAV controller will first check out 
the energy and storage constraints of the required sensor set, as described in Alg. \ref{}. 
If the task requirement exceeds the capacity of the sensor set, it will be sent to a     
task queue; Otherwise it will be put into the task buffer to conduct.


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sensor Constraint Detection}
\label{Constraint}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Input: Sensor set $N$, Task $T$;
\STATE Input: Remaining Energy for each node :$Energy(u_i)$;
\STATE Input: Remaining Storage for each node :$Energy(u_i)$;
\STATE Initialize: Energy capacity $\eta$, Storage capacity $\xi$;
\STATE Calculate the energy cost of $T$ for each sensor as : $\phi$;
\STATE Calculate the storage cost of $T$ for each sensor as :$\varphi$;
\FOR{Each node $u_i$ in $N$}
	\IF{$Energy(u_i)+\phi \geq \eta \Vert Storage(u_i)+\varphi \geq \xi$}
   	 \STATE Set $T$ to task queue;
   	 \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE Set $T$ to task buffer;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


A sensor node may have different sensing ranges for different tasks.


There are several practical requirements.

Different tasks have different requirements, including time, sensing range, sensing ratio, etc.

For example tasks like sunlight collection only need to be carried out during the daytime.

Our system provide a task scheduling to 

Sensors are usually assigned multi-task.

Sensors are assigned tasks to monitor a specific area.

\begin{table*}[htbp]
	\caption{Task Buffer}
	\label{TB}

	\scalebox{0.9}{
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		Task ID& Node set& Sensing rate & Sensing range& Sensing duration \\

		Task ID& Node set& Sensing rate & Sensing range& Sensing duration \\

	}
\end{table*}

Different tasks have different requirements, i.e. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Node set.} Users can assign tasks to 
\item \textbf{Sensing rate.}
\item \textbf{Sensing range.} The maximum distance that a node can detect. 

\item \textbf{Sensing duration.} The sensing time from start to end. 
There is no need to collect sunlight data at night.
