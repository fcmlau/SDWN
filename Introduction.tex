\section{Introduction}

Why we are SDN ?

Software defined network is able to support flexible network programmability 
by using programmable data plane and centralized network controller.

OpenFlow focus on wired networks.

Challenges and opportunities of SDN for WSN:

Challenges: Limited resources of WSN nodes:
\begin{itemize}
\item	energy
\item	processing
\item	memory
\item	communication
\end{itemize}

Opportunities: 
\begin{itemize}
\item	Improve resource reuse
\item	Implement node retasking 
\item	Node and network management
\item	Enable experiments with new protocols
\end{itemize}

Existing SDN for WSN:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Flow-Sensor
\item	Sensor OpenFlow
\item	SDWN
\item	TinySDN
\item	SDN-WISE
\end{itemize}
All of these are evaluated by simulations




Flow-Sensor [MahmudandRahmani2011], 
Sensor OpenFlow [Luoetal.2012] 
SDWN [Costanzo et al. 2012]
TinySDN [de Oliveira et al. 2014]
SDN-WISE [Galluccio et al. 2015]
