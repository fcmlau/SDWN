\section{Introduction}

Why we are SDN ?

Software defined network is able to support flexible network programmability 
by using programmable data plane and centralized network controller.

OpenFlow focus on wired networks.

Challenges and opportunities of SDN for WSN:

Challenges: Limited resources of WSN nodes:
\begin{itemize}
\item	energy
\item	processing
\item	memory
\item	communication
\end{itemize}

Opportunities: 
\begin{itemize}
\item	Improve resource reuse
\item	Implement node retasking 
\item	Node and network management
\item	Enable experiments with new protocols
\end{itemize}



Why and How we can implement AI ?

How we combine Ai with other applications?


AI 

AI systems have been improving, and new advances in machine intelligence are creating seamless interactions between people and digital sensor systems.

 In sensor systems, applications can be found for a variety of tasks, including selection of sensor inputs, interpreting signals, condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, machine and process control, machine design, process planning, production scheduling, and system configuring. Some examples of specific tasks undertaken by expert systems are:
* Assembly 
* Automatic programming 
* Controlling intelligent complex vehicles  
* Planning inspection 
* Predicting risk of disease 
* Selecting tools and machining strategies 
* Sequence planning 
* Controlling plant growth. 

.



The tools and methods described have minimal computation complexity and can be implemented on small assembly lines, single robots, or systems with low-capability microcontrollers. These novel approaches proposed use ambient intelligence and the mixing of different AI tools in an effort to use the best of each technology. The concepts are generically applicable across many processes.


minimum energy, data loss, reliability, robustness, etc., in place during the design and operation of wireless sensor networks

a specific set of protocols for medium access, localization and positioning, time synchronization, topology control, security and routing are identified based on the current configuration of the network, the requirements of the application and the topology of their deployment.
