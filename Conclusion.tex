\section{Conclusion}
\label{Con}

In this paper, we present {\sdn}, the first practical SDN 
wireless sensor network system,
which achieves intelligence, high-performance and 
resilience at the same time for general applications. 
Five typical applications: routing, network diagnosis, AI energy prediction, 
AI node selection and multi-task are realized in {\sdn}.
Our experiments show that {\sdn} 
improves the throughput by 80\% and prolongs the average lifetime of sensor nodes by 20\%. 
By running diagnosis and AI selection applications together, 
{\sdn} further increases the lifetime by 25\% and 35\% more, respectively.
All source code and results of Malak are ready to open source.
