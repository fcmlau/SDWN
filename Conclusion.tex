\section{Conclusion}
\label{Con}

In this paper, we preset {\sdn}, the first practical SDN 
wireless sensor network system,
which achieves intelligence, high-performance and 
resilience at the same time for general applications. 
Five typical applications: routing, network diagnosis, AI energy prediction, 
AI node selection and multi-task are realized in {\sdn}.
%
Our experiments show that {\sdn} 
%
{\sdn} provides easy-to-use interfaces 
and it realizes global optimization and 
can further promote the deployment of IoTs..
