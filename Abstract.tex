Software defined network (SDN) enables  
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be implemented easily, and in
turn AI techniques greatly improve the performance and resilience of SDN system.
However, all the existing SDN systems in wireless sensor networks
are implemented by simulations and there is no practical 
implementation of SDN system in WSN.

In this paper, we present {\sdn}, the first practical SDN wireless sensor network system,
which achieves intelligence, high-performance and resilience at the same time.
In {\sdn}, we utilize the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to serve as the SDN controller. 
The UAV communicates with network nodes by one-hop communication and thus greatly
reduce the network energy consumption. 
We designed easy-to-use interfaces and implemented five SDN applications, namely
routing, multi-task, network diagnosis, AI energy exhaustion prediction, AI node selection.
We also to users and the code is ready to be open source.
Our evaluations show the throughput improves {\simpleTput} compared with the RPL protocol
by using the basic {\sdn} routing algorithm. Meanwhile, the lifetime grows by
{\simpleLife} compared with RPL. And after deploying diagnosis and AI
selection algorithm, the lifetime even increases by {\diagLife} and {\seleLife}
more, respectively. Besides, the packet received ratio keeps over 90\% in both
small and large scale network. Code of {\sdn} is ready to open source.
