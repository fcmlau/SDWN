Software defined network (SDN) enables  
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be implemented easily, and in
turn AI techniques greatly improve the performance and resilience of SDN system.
However, all the existing SDN systems in wireless sensor networks
are implemented in simulators and there is no practical 
implementation of SDN system in WSN.

In this paper, we present {\sdn}, the first practical SDN wireless sensor network system,
which achieves intelligence, high-performance and resilience at the same time.
In {\sdn}, we utilize a set of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve as the SDN controllers. 
UAVs communicate with sensor nodes by one-hop communication and thus greatly
reduce the network energy consumption. 
We designed easy-to-use interfaces and implemented five SDN applications, namely
routing, multi-task, network diagnosis, AI energy exhaustion prediction, AI node selection.
{\sdn} is an organic ecosystem that all applications can run simultaneously to benefit each other.
Our evaluations show the throughput improves {\simpleTput} compared with two notable protocols
by using the basic {\sdn} routing algorithm. Meanwhile, the average lifetime of sensor nodes grows by
{\simpleLife}. By running diagnosis and AI
selection applications together, {\sdn} further increases the lifetime by {\diagLife} and {\seleLife}
more, respectively. All source code and results of {\sdn} are ready to open source.
