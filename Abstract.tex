Software defined network (SDN) enables  
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be implemented easily, and in
turn AI techniques greatly improve the performance and resilience of SDN system.
However, all the existing SDN systems in wireless sensor networks are implemented
in simulators and there is no practical implementation.

In this paper, we present {\sdn}, the first practical SDN wireless sensor network system,
which achieves intelligence, high-performance and resilience simultaneously.
In {\sdn}, we utilize a set of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve as the SDN controllers. 
UAVs communicate with sensor nodes by one-hop communication and thus greatly
reduce the network energy consumption. 
We designed easy-to-use interfaces and implemented five SDN applications, namely
routing, multi-task, network diagnosis, AI energy exhaustion prediction, AI node selection.
{\sdn} is a ecosystem that all applications can run simultaneously to benefit each other.
Our evaluations show the throughput improves by {\simpleTput} compared with two notable protocols.
%by using the basic {\sdn} routing algorithm. 
Meanwhile, the average lifetime of sensor nodes grows by
{\simpleLife}. By running energy prediction %and AI selection 
application, {\sdn} further increases the lifetime by {\totalLife}. %and {\seleLife}
All source code and results of {\sdn} are ready to open source.



%throughput improves by 1.2X compared to two notable traditional sensor network routing protocols.

%throughput    comparing with other provence,  still maintains initial throughput
