Software defined network (SDN) enables  
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be implemented easily, and in
turn AI techniques greatly improve the performance of SDN system.
However, all the existing SDN systems in wireless sensor networks
are implemented by simulations and there is no practical 
implementation of SDN system in WSN.

In this paper, we present {\sdn}, the first practical SDN wireless sensor network system,
which achieves intelligence, high-performance and resilience at the same time.
In {\sdn}, we utilize the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to serve as the SDN controller. 
The UAV communicates with network nodes by one-hop communication and thus greatly
reduce the network energy consumption. We designed and implemented five applications, namely
routing, network diagnosis, AI energy prediction, AI node selection and multi-task.
We also provide easy-to-use interfaces to users and the code is ready to be open source.
