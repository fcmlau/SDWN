\section{Network construction}

\subsection{Sensor selection}
ssss
Physical topology :  uniform distribution (Density ρ).

Sensor selection algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1)] A simple cluster algorithm: threshold δ -The distance between sensors \&\& the overlapping of sensing area \&\& the similar neighbor list. 
\item[2)] SRSSS Algorithm (AAAI-16) - trained by an AI model based on the collected data. 
\end{itemize}

Output : Redundant nodes

\subsection{Topology Mapping}

Redundant nodes are mapped to a virtual node. 
They can awaken each other according to their  residual energy. 
When:    
$$
\begin{aligned}                        
ResidualEnergy(i) \leq \xi \cdot ResidualEnergy(j) & &   {turn~node~i~to~node~j}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

These virtual nodes are called critical nodes in the logical topology while other nodes are called ordinary nodes.
